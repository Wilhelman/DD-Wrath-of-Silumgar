# DUNGEONS & DRAGONS: SHADOW OVER MYSTARA

Project II for Videogame Development subject. The main goal here is to redesign the arcade game Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara. Enemies pathfinding is implemented along other stuff such as stable frame rate (60fps), normalized movement, structured entity system described in an UML file and code with Brofiler integration. We also have added an intro menu and HUD implemented through a structured ui system described in a UML file.

This project has been done by seven spanish students of CITM - UPC (Terrasa, Spain).

## About the game
Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara is an arcade game created and published by Capcom in 1996 and it's a sequel of Dungeons & Dragons: Tower of Doom. The game combines the genre of beat'em up with a lot of aspects about the role-playing. Brought a great innovation around the mechanics of the inventory system and habilities mechanics.
We're going to redesign around JRPG genre. Check our game design document and stay tuned: [Game  Design Document](https://github.com/Wilhelman/DD-Shadow-over-Mystara/wiki/Game-Design-Document)
